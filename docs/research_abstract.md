# Research Abstract

Synkage is a situation-aware execution copilot architecture designed to coordinate intelligent task execution across tools, applications, and agent runtimes. The system separates decision intelligence from execution substrates through layered orchestration, bounded autonomy, and safety-first routing.

The architecture combines intent resolution, context sensing, agent specialization, and skill-based execution with strict autonomy guards and confirmation gates. Instead of replacing tools, Synkage acts as a meta-controller that selects the fastest valid execution path across local tools, browser automation, and external agent runtimes.

Primary contributions include autonomy bounding, situation-driven execution routing, agent skill modularization, and adapter-based runtime integration. The design emphasizes modularity, safety, reversibility, and extensibility over conversational capability.

Synkage targets reliable, human-directed task execution rather than open-ended dialogue systems.
